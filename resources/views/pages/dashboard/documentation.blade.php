                            assist multi-sectoral district-level stakeholders in health (including nutrition, family
                            planning), education, social protection, agriculture, and water, sanitation, and hygiene in
                            designing activities to address undernutrition in their district. </p>

                        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold  text-sm">Approach</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">Through facilitated discussions, stakeholders will review
                            existing
                            data, prioritize behaviors, map platforms and channels, examine barriers, and design
                            activities that meet the needs of their district. The tool provides a logical step-by-step
                            process and is divided into 9 steps. The tool encourages stakeholders to use data in their
                            decision-making process. The district profile sheet accompanies this tool. Since
                            district-level data are not always available, we recommend stakeholders use their best
                            judgment. Given USAID Integrated Nutrition's emphasis on addressing the needs of underserved
                            populations, each step of the tool guides stakeholders to consider data and activities for
                            everyone in their district and for underserved populations.
